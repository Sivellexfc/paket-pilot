# Fixed: Filter Notification

I have added a visual indicator for filtered items.

## Changes:
1.  **Info Banner:** A green notification bar now appears at the bottom of the "Hazırlanmayı Bekleyen Siparişler" list if any orders are hidden.
2.  **Feedback:** It explicitly states how many orders were filtered out because they are already shipped.
3.  **Dismissible:** The banner can be closed by clicking the X button.

This ensures you know that data hasn't been lost, just effectively filtered.
