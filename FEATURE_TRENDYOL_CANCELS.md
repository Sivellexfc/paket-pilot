# Added: Dynamic Trendyol Cancelled Orders

I have transformed the "İptaller Arşivi" into a dynamic dashboard for managing Trendyol cancellations.

## Features:
1.  **Trendyol Integration:** Click **"Trendyol Getir"** to fetch real-time cancelled orders from Trendyol for the selected time range.
2.  **Smart Status Tracking:**
    *   **"Kargoya Verilen İptal" (Orange):** The system detected that this order was already shipped in your Cargo Archive.
    *   **"Hazırlanırken İptal" (Gray):** The order was already marked as cancelled in your local records.
    *   **"İptal" (Red):** Standard cancellation.
3.  **Return Management:**
    *   For items marked as "Kargoya Verilen İptal", you can click the **"İade Al"** checkbox.
    *   After confirming, the system removes the order from the Cargo Archive, keeping your shipping records accurate.

This provides a complete workflow for handling cancellations that occur after shipping.
