# Fixed: Archive Date Range

I have updated the "Kargo Arşivi" page to support viewing records over a range of time.

## Changes:
1.  **New Dropdown:** You can now select "Son 1 Hafta", "Son 2 Hafta", "Son 1 Ay", etc.
2.  **Date Picker:** The date picker is now hidden by default and only appears if you select "Tarih Seç".
3.  **Merged View:** The list now shows all entries relevant to the selected time range (e.g., all last week's shipments).

Default view is now "Son 1 Hafta" as requested.
